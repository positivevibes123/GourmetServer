## How to edit
First you gotta create a fork of this repository. Cloning a repo just makes  anything you type in there will be mirrored onto the server. when you are done making changes, create a pull request that merges your changes from your fork into soapstain22/GourmetServer/master. If your pr is nice i will accept it and it will be added into the server.

This sounds really complicated but all you have to do is create your own fork of the server by using the button at the top of the github page. just make changes on your fork and create a pull request and it will be in the server. use a codespace to  Google is your friend with this process, so if you dont get sonmething just look it up

## How to Run you own server
- Linux: Run the following command in the root directory
```
bash run.sh
```
server should fetch the latest changes from the repo and will run on java port 25565, and bedrock port 19132. ports are set up right out of the box, so if people cant connect to your version of the server its almost 100% because of a port forwarding issue
